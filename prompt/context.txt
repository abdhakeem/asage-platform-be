Scope 1
 Definition
   Stationary combustion
 Direct emissions from stationary combustion, which are the consequence of combustion of any type of fuel (fossil or biomass) burnt in stationary (fixed equipment, such as heaters, gas turbines, boilers. This could be done to generate heat, mechanical work andsteam.
   Mobile combustion
 Direct emissions from mobile combustion, which are the consequence of fuel burnt in transport equipment, such as motor vehicles, trucks, ships, aircraft, locomotives fork lift trucks.

Emissions from journeys in vehicles not included within the organizational boundaries should be reported as "indirect emissions" arising from business travel, employee commuting, client or visitors transport, upstream leased assets, etc.
   Fugitive emissions
 Examples of industrial processes that result in direct process emissions include, but are not limited to, cement and lime production, chemical production, manufacturing, oil and gas refining, and non-combustion processes involving the avoidance, replacement, destruction, decomposition or mitigation of industrial GHG emissions (e.g. N20) and purification processes associated with carbon capture and storage (e.g. amine solution capture systems).
   Process emissions
 Direct fugitive emissions can come from systems that extract, process, store, and deliver fossil fuels (e.g. flanges, valves, unions and threaded connections); from equipment leaks (e.g. cooling systems); from agricultural processes (e.g. putrefaction and fermentation, manure, livestock, application of nitrogen fertilizers); and from uncontrolled decomposition of waste material from such sources as landfills, composting facilities, waste water treatment, and other waste management processes.

Emissions from flaring or venting are quantified as "direct emissions". Emissions from flaring and venting could be unintentional or intentional. Examples include: designed releases of CH4 or COz containing natural gas or hydrocarbon gas (not including stationary combustion flue gas to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes; equipment blowdown for maintenance; and direct venting of gas used to power equipment (such as pneumatic devices).
NOTE 4 Intentional reversals of carbon removals, such as back burning to prevent future forest fires, are quantified as anthropogenic biogenic emissions (negative removal) and reported in accordance with Annex D.
   Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)
 Direct emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), which covers all GHGs, from living biomass to organic matter in soils. According to IPCC guidelines [15), emissions can be assessed in six main land-use categories (forest land, cropland, grassland, wetland, settlement, other land) and several carbon reservoirs (living above-ground biomass, living underground biomass, deadwood, leaf litter, soil organic matter). A change in carbon stock can occur when land use change from one category to another (e.g. converting forest to crop land or within a land use category (e.g. converting a natural forest to a managed forest, converting from till to no-till). Removals occur when there is an increase of carbon stock in the reservoirs. Emissions occur when there is a decrease and when N2.0 is emitted.

Options for quantification methodologies: COze emissions associated with LULUCF occur after actions have been undertaken which generate differences in carbon stocks. The period of time after this action is generally set as 20 years. Thus, organizations may quantify either all emissions associated with the action total carbon stock differences) or annual emissions (1/20 of total carbon stocks differences. If the second option is chosen, emissions should be reported "each time" during a 20-year period.

With respect to GHG emissions and removals connected to marine areas, only very limited information is available.


   Scope 2
 Definition
   Purchased electricity
 Indirect emissions from imported electricity, including HG emissions related to the production and consumption of electricity imported by theorganization.
   Purchased energy (heating, cooling and compressed air)
 Indirect emissions from imported energy, including GHG emissions related to the production of energy consumed by the organization through a physical network (steam, heating, cooling and compressed air), excluding electricity.


   Scope 3
 Definition
   Purchased Goods and Services
 Emissions from purchased goods, which are emissions associated with the fabrication of the product. As this could encompass a wide range of products, further subcategorization may be defined by the intended user. For example, subcategorization may distinguish products by type of materials (steel, plastic, glass, electronic, etc.) or by function in the value chain (production related product versus non-production related product). This subcategory includes emissions associated
with the producion o enerey purchased me. nostream emissions associated wich o and electricity production that are not otherwise included in category tor indirect GG emissions from energy (B.3).
   Capital Goods
 Emissions trom capital goods are emissions from goods that are purchased and amortized by the organizacon. This includes goods used oy the oreanvacon to manulacture a product provide a service, or sell, store and deliver merchandise. Generally, capital goods have an extended lifetime and are neither transformed nor sold to another organization or to consumers. This subcategory includes all tostream emissions from the procuccon o capital goods burchased or acquired by
the reportne oreanization.
Examples of capital goods include equipment, machinery, buildings, facilities and vehicles. In
hinancial accounting, capital equipment is treated as fixed assets or plant, property and equipment.
Options for quantification methodologies: Emissions within this subcategory could include either the total of emissions associated with the production of the capital good or an amortized part of
the total based on accounting rules or lite time duration). It the second option is chosen emissions should be reported pro-rata during the amortization period
When cozis stored as carbon in goods for a spected time, this carbon storage should be treated according to the methodology defined in ISO 14067.
   Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities Not Included in Scope 1 or Scope 2
 Emissions related to the production of fuels and energy purchased and consumed by the reporting company in the reporting year that are not included in scope 1 or scope 2.
   Upstream Transportation and Distribution
 Emissions from upstream transport and distribution for goods, which are emissions from freight services that are paid for by the organization.
Options for quantification methodologies: Missions could include either the latest transport activity from the supplier to the organization, or all transport activities throughout the supply chain.
In respect to which option is chosen, attention should be paid to the interaction with the category for indirect GHG emissions from products used by an organization.
   Waste Generated in Operations
 Emissions from the disposal of solid and liquid waste depend upon the characteristics of waste and its treatment. The typical type of treatment is landfill, incineration, biological treatment or recycling process. The principal emissions are CO2 and CH4 and an associated emission is N20, which occurs in incineration or biological treatment.
Options for quantification methodologies: Emissions from waste transportation (from organization to disposal facility could be quantified either in this category or in the category for indirect GHG emissions from transportation (B.4). In respect to which option is chosen, attention should be paid to omission or double counting issues.
   Business Travel
 Emissions from business travel mainly due to fuel burnt in mobile sources of combustion.
Hotel nights might be included when linked to the business travel, ie. a stay over for flight connections, when attending a conference or for other business purposes. The indirect emissions generated during the journey should also be included, if such data are available and significant.
   Employee Commuting
 Emissions from employee commuting, including emissions related to the transportation of employees from their homes to their workplaces. Telecommuting may incur a greater use of energy for heating or cooling from part of the employee's energy consumption at home and thus could be considered in this subcategory.
   Upstream Leased Assets
 Emissions from the use of assets are generated through equipment leased by the reporting organization in the reporting year. This subcategory is only applicable to an organization that operates leased assets (i.e. lessees). Leases depend on the nature of item leased, length of the lease, financial and contractual arrangements. Three main types of leasing could be identified as: finance leasing, operating leasing and contract hire. The organization should pay attention to ensure there is not double counting with direct emissions (e.g. vehicle fleet).
An organization using the operational control method of consolidation may quantify these emissions as direct emissions.
   Downstream Transportation and Distribution
 Emissions from downstream transport and distribution for goods are emissions from freight services that are due to the first purchasers or other purchasers throughout the supply chain but not paid for by the organization.
As for upstream transport and distribution for goods, the same options for quantification methodologies apply.
   Processing of Sold Products
 Emissions from processing of sold intermediate products by third parties (e.g., manufacturers) subsequent to sale by the reporting company. Intermediate products are products that require further processing, transformation, or inclusion in another product before use (see box 5.3 of the Scope 3 Standard), and therefore result in emissions from processing subsequent to sale by the reporting company and before use by the end consumer. Emissions from processing should be allocated to the intermediate product.
   Use of Sold Products
 Emissions or removals from the use stage of the product include the total expected lifetime emissions from all relevant products sold. The emissions from this subcategory are very closely linked to the life stage scenarios. From a general point of view, the more the product is a final product, the easier it is to define scenarios. For example, it is easier for a motor vehicle manufacturer to define vehicle use scenarios (in order to evaluate motor vehicle energy consumption) than for a steel supplier who has a bigger range of application scenarios for its products.
   End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products
 Emissions from end of life stage of the product include the emissions associated with the end of life of all products sold by the reporting organization in the reporting year. Generally, the emissions sources and sinks are those concerned with disposal of solid and liquid waste (B.4.1).
However, for the use stage of the product (B.5.1), the organization should define "end of life scenarios". Consequently, the emissions from this subcategory are closely linked to these scenarios.
   Downstream Leased Assets
 Emissions from downstream leased assets include those from the operation of assets that are owned by the reporting organization and leased to other entities during the reporting year. This subcategory is applicable to the lessors (i.e. an organization that receives payments from lessees).
   Franchises
 Emissions from the operation of franchises not included in scope 1 or scope 2. A franchise is a business operating under a license to sell or distribute another company’s goods or services within a certain location. This category is applicable to franchisors (i.e., companies that grant licenses to other entities to sell or distribute its goods or services in return for payments, such as royalties for the use of trademarks and other services). Franchisors should account for emissions that occur from the operation of franchises (i.e., the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of franchisees) in this category
   Investments
 Emissions from investments are mainly targeting private or public financial institutions.
Emissions could result from four types of operations: equity debt, investment debt, project finance and others.

More context:
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions
Direct GHG emissions occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company, for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.; emissions from chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment. Direct CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass shall not be included in scope 1 but reported separately (see chapter 9). GHG emissions not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, e.g. CFCs, NOx, etc. shall not be included in scope 1 but may be reported separately (see chapter 9).
Scope 2: Electricity indirect GHG emissions
Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company.
Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is purchased or otherwise brought into the organizational boundary of the company. Scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where electricity is generated.
Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions
Scope 3 is an optional reporting category that allows for the treatment of all other indirect emissions. Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. Some examples of scope 3 activities are extraction and production of purchased materials; transportation of purchased fuels; and use of sold products and services.
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions
Companies report GHG emissions from sources they own or control as scope 1. Direct GHG emissions are principally the result of the following types of activities undertaken by the company:
• Generation of electricity, heat, or steam. These emissions result from combustion of fuels in stationary sources, e.g., boilers, furnaces, turbines
• Physical or chemical processing. Most of these emissions result from manufacture or processing of chemicals and materials, e.g., cement, aluminum, adipic acid, ammonia manufacture, and waste processing
• Transportation of materials, products, waste, and employees. These emissions result from the combustion of fuels in company-owned/controlled mobile combustion sources (e.g., trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, buses, and cars)
• Fugitive emissions. These emissions result from intentional or unintentional releases, e.g., equipment leaks from joints, seals, packing, and gaskets; methane emissions from coal mines and venting; hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions during the use of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment; and methane leakages from gas transport.

SALE OF OWN-GENERATED ELECTRICITY
Emissions associated with the sale of own-generated electricity to another company are not deducted/netted from scope 1. This treatment of sold electricity is consistent with how other sold GHG-intensive products are accounted, e.g., emissions from the production of sold clinker by a cement company or the production of scrap steel by an iron and steel company are not subtracted from their scope 1 emissions. Emissions associated with the sale/transfer of own-generated electricity may be reported in optional information (see chapter 9).
Scope 2: Electricity indirect GHG emissions
Companies report the emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that is consumed in its owned or controlled equipment or operations as scope 2. Scope 2 emissions are a special category of indirect emissions. For many companies, purchased electricity represents one of the largest sources of GHG emissions and the most significant opportunity to reduce these emissions. Accounting for scope 2 emissions allows companies to assess the risks and opportunities associated with changing electricity and GHG emissions costs. Another important reason for companies to track these emissions is that the information may be needed for some GHG programs.
Companies can reduce their use of electricity by investing in energy-efficient technologies and energy conservation. Additionally, emerging green power markets provide opportunities for some companies to switch to less GHG intensive sources of electricity. Companies can also install an efficient on-site co-generation plant, particularly if it replaces the purchase of more GHG intensive electricity from the grid or electricity supplier. Reporting of scope 2 emissions allows transparent accounting of GHG emissions and reductions associated with such opportunities.

INDIRECT EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
Electric utility companies often purchase electricity from independent power generators or the grid and resell it to end-consumers through a transmission and distribution (T&D) system.5 A portion of the electricity purchased by a utility company is consumed (T&D loss) during its transmission and distribution to end-consumers (see Box 3). Consistent with the scope 2 definition, emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that is consumed during transmission and distribution are reported in scope 2 by the company that owns or controls the T&D operation. End consumers of the purchased electricity do not report indirect emissions associated with T&D losses in scope 2 because they do not own or control the T&D operation where the electricity is consumed (T&D loss).
This approach ensures that there is no double counting within scope 2 since only the T&D utility company will account for indirect emissions associated with T&D losses in scope 2. Another advantage of this approach is that it adds simplicity to the reporting of scope 2 emissions by allowing the use of commonly available emission factors that in most cases do not include T&D losses.
End consumers may, however, report their indirect emissions associated with T&D losses in scope 3 under the category “generation of electricity consumed in a T&D system.” Appendix A provides more guidance on accounting for emissions associated with T&D losses.
OTHER ELECTRICITY-RELATED INDIRECT EMISSIONS
Indirect emissions from activities upstream of a company’s electricity provider (e.g., exploration, drilling, flaring, transportation) are reported under scope 3. Emissions from the generation of electricity that has been purchased for resale to end-users are reported in scope 3 under the category “generation of electricity that is purchased and then resold to end users.” Emissions from the generation of purchased electricity for resale to non-end-users (e.g., electricity traders) may be reported separately from scope 3 in “optional information.”
The following two examples illustrate how GHG emissions are accounted for from the generation, sale, and purchase of electricity.
Example one (Figure 4): Company A is an independent power generator that owns a power generation plant. The power plant produces 100 MWh of electricity and releases 20 tonnes of emissions per year. Company B is an electricity trader and has a supply contract with company A to purchase all its electricity. Company B resells the purchased electricity (100 MWh) to company C, a utility company that owns/controls the T&D system. Company C consumes 5 MWh of electricity in its T&D system and sells the remaining 95 MWh to company D. Company D is an end user who consumes the purchased electricity (95 MWh) in its own operations. Company A reports its direct emissions from power generation under scope 1. Company B reports emissions from the purchased electricity sold to a non-end-user as optional information separately from scope 3. Company C reports the indirect emissions from the generation of the part of the purchased electricity that is sold to the end-user under scope 3 and the part of the purchased electricity that it consumes in its T&D system under scope 2. End-user D reports the indirect emissions associated with its own consumption of purchased electricity under scope 2 and can optionally report emissions associated with upstream T&D losses in scope 3. Figure 4 shows the accounting of emissions associated with these transactions.

Example two: Company D installs a co-generation unit and sells surplus electricity to a neighboring company E for its consumption. Company D reports all direct emissions from the co-generation unit under scope 1. Indirect emissions from the generation of electricity for export to E are reported by D under optional information separately from scope 3. Company E reports indirect emissions associated with the consumption of electricity purchased from the company D’s co-generation unit under scope 2. For more guidance, see Appendix A on accounting for indirect emissions from purchased electricity.

Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions 
Scope 3 is optional, but it provides an opportunity to be innovative in GHG management. Companies may want to focus on accounting for and reporting those activities that are relevant to their business and goals, and for which they have reliable information. Since companies have discretion over which categories they choose to report, scope 3 may not lend itself well to comparisons across companies. This section provides an indicative list of scope 3 categories and includes case studies on some of the categories. Some of these activities will be included under scope 1 if the pertinent emission sources are owned or controlled by the company (e.g., if the transportation of products is done in vehicles owned or controlled by the company). To determine if an activity falls within scope 1 or scope 3, the company should refer to the selected consolidation approach (equity or control) used in setting its organizational boundaries. 

• Extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels 
• Transport-related activities 
• Transportation of purchased materials or goods 
• Transportation of purchased fuels 
• Employee business travel 
• Employees commuting to and from work 
• Transportation of sold products 
• Transportation of waste
• Electricity-related activities not included in scope 2 (see Appendix A) 
• Extraction, production, and transportation of fuels consumed in the generation of electricity (either purchased or own generated by the reporting company) 
• Purchase of electricity that is sold to an end user (reported by utility company)
• Generation of electricity that is consumed in a T&D system (reported by end-user) 
• Leased assets, franchises, and outsourced activities—emissions from such contractual arrangements are only classified as scope 3 if the selected consolidation approach (equity or control) does not apply to them. 

Clarification on the classification of leased assets should be obtained from the company accountant (see section on leases below). 
• Use of sold products and services 
• Waste disposal 
• Disposal of waste generated in operations 
• Disposal of waste generated in the production of purchased materials and fuels 
• Disposal of sold products at the end of their life

ACCOUNTING FOR SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS
Accounting for scope 3 emissions need not involve a full-blown GHG life cycle analysis of all products and operations. Usually it is valuable to focus on one or two major GHG-generating activities.
Although it is difficult to provide generic guidance on which scope 3 emissions to include in an inventory, some general steps can be articulated:
Describe the value chain.
Because the assessment of scope 3 emissions does not require a full life cycle assessment, it is important, for the sake of transparency, to provide a general description of the value chain and the associated GHG sources. For this step, the scope 3 categories listed can be used as a checklist.
Companies usually face choices on how many levels up- and down-stream to include in scope 3.
Consideration of the company’s inventory or business goals and relevance of the various scope 3 categories will guide these choices.
Determine which scope 3 categories are relevant.
Only some types of upstream or downstream emissions categories might be relevant to the company. They may be relevant for several reasons:

They are large (or believed to be large) relative to the company’s scope 1 and scope 2 emissions
They contribute to the company’s GHG risk exposure
They are deemed critical by key stakeholders (e.g., feedback from customers, suppliers, investors, or civil society)
There are potential emissions reductions that could be undertaken or influenced by the company

The following examples may help decide which scope 3 categories are relevant to the company.
If fossil fuel or electricity is required to use the company’s products, product use phase emissions may be a relevant category to report. This may be especially important if the company can influence product design attributes (e.g., energy efficiency) or customer behavior in ways that reduce GHG emissions during the use of the products.
Outsourced activities are often candidates for scope 3 emissions assessments. It may be particularly important to include these when a previously outsourced activity contributed significantly to a company’s scope 1 or scope 2 emissions. If GHG-intensive materials represent a significant fraction of the weight or composition of a product used or manufactured (e.g., cement, aluminum), companies may want to examine whether there are opportunities to reduce their consumption of the product or to substitute less GHG-intensive materials
